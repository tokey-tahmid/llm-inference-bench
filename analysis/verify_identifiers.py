"""Verify every identifier written in prose against ground truth.

    python analysis/verify_identifiers.py     # exit 1 if anything is unverifiable

Guards the workspace's first non-negotiable rule at the one place it is easiest
to break by accident: prose. Figures and tables are generated from
``results/raw/`` and cannot drift, but a README is typed, and a long hex string
is exactly the kind of token that gets confidently completed rather than copied.

That is not hypothetical. An unattended run wrote the Qwen2.5-32B revision as
``5ede1c97bbabb0aa9f9baec87cf35664fea1fe1e``. The true value, in the lockfile and
in all 384 artifacts, is ``5ede1c97bbab6ce5cda5812749b4c0bdf79b18dd``. The first
twelve characters match and the rest was invented, because figure captions
truncate revisions to twelve characters and the tail was reconstructed from
nothing. Every measurement around it was real; only the identifier was false,
which is the most dangerous shape such an error can take.

Ground truth is the union of the provisioning lockfile and the provenance blocks
of every raw artifact. Anything hex-like and >=12 characters in a prose file must
prefix-match one of those.
